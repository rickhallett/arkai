# Phase 1: Core Functionality

## Overview

Phase 1 focuses on building the core functionality of the Virtual Psychology Assistant. This phase lays the foundation for the chatbot, database setup, and initial user management features. The goal is to establish a stable and user-friendly core that can be expanded upon in later phases.

## Tasks Breakdown

### 1. [Requirements Gathering](/requirements-gathering.md)
- **Objective**: Identify all necessary features and specifications required for the chatbot, resource database, and user management system.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Conduct user interviews and gather feedback from stakeholders.
  - Define use cases and establish functional and non-functional requirements.
  - Document technical requirements for backend, frontend, and database components.

### 2. Chatbot Interface Design
- **Objective**: Develop an engaging and user-friendly conversational interface.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Create initial wireframes for the chatbot interface.
  - Develop a prototype for the conversational flow, considering empathy and ease of use.
  - Design interface components for interaction, including user input fields, chat bubbles, and feedback prompts.

### 3. Database Setup
- **Objective**: Design and set up the database to store therapeutic resources, session notes, and user account information.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Choose the database type (SQL, NoSQL) based on the project requirements.
  - Define the database schema, including tables for resources, users, and session notes.
  - Set up database hosting and ensure proper backup and security measures are in place.

## Deliverables
- **Requirements Document**: A comprehensive document outlining all features and specifications.
- **Chatbot Prototype**: An interactive prototype demonstrating the conversational flow.
- **Database Schema**: A defined database schema and initial database setup.

## Timeline
- **Requirements Gathering**: 2-3 weeks
- **Chatbot Interface Design**: 2-4 weeks
- **Database Setup**: 2-3 weeks

## Dependencies
- **Frontend Framework**: The chatbot interface will be built using a suitable frontend framework (e.g., React).
- **Backend Services**: A backend framework (e.g., Node.js, Flask) to handle server-side operations and connect to the database.
- **Database Management System**: Selection of a suitable database, such as PostgreSQL or MongoDB, depending on the flexibility and scalability requirements.

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Incomplete Requirements**: Engage stakeholders regularly to validate requirements and make necessary adjustments early.
- **Interface Usability Issues**: Conduct usability testing during the design phase to ensure the chatbot is intuitive.
- **Data Security Concerns**: Set up encryption mechanisms and data access controls to mitigate security risks from the start.

## Next Steps
- After Phase 1, proceed to Phase 2, which focuses on adding personalized resource matching logic and secure user account management.
