# Chat Application Component Outline

## Overview
This document provides a component structure for a basic wireframe chat application built using `create-react-app`. The focus is to create a functional workflow where user input is processed, and responses are generated. The application should be designed in a modular way to easily switch between a mock and live database. Styling will be considered in later phases.

## Component Outline

### 1. **App Component**
- **Path**: `src/App.js`
- **Role**: Serves as the root component of the application. Handles routing and state management for the overall application.
- **Key Features**:
  - Renders the main ChatPage component.
  - Configures global state using React Context if needed.

### 2. **ChatPage Component**
- **Path**: `src/components/ChatPage.js`
- **Role**: Main container that holds the chat UI, manages user interactions, and interfaces with the backend for responses.
- **Key Features**:
  - Maintains overall chat history state.
  - Provides user input and response handling.
  - Renders the ChatWindow and InputBox components.

### 3. **ChatWindow Component**
- **Path**: `src/components/ChatWindow.js`
- **Role**: Displays the conversation history between the user and the assistant.
- **Key Features**:
  - Takes chat history from props and renders each message.
  - Scrollable to ensure a good user experience.

### 4. **InputBox Component**
- **Path**: `src/components/InputBox.js`
- **Role**: Handles user input for the chat.
- **Key Features**:
  - Text input field for user messages.
  - Button to submit user input.
  - On-submit event triggers a function in the ChatPage component.

### 5. **Message Component**
- **Path**: `src/components/Message.js`
- **Role**: Represents an individual message within the chat.
- **Key Features**:
  - Takes message text and sender information from props and renders appropriately.
  - Differentiates between user and assistant messages for styling purposes.

### 6. **Database Service Module**
- **Path**: `src/services/database.js`
- **Role**: Provides an abstraction layer for database operations, enabling easy switching between mock and live databases.
- **Key Features**:
  - Functions for reading from and writing to the database.
  - Configurable option to switch between a mock data source and a live database API endpoint.

### 7. **Mock Database Module**
- **Path**: `src/services/mockDatabase.js`
- **Role**: Mock database for testing during development.
- **Key Features**:
  - Mock data stored as JSON objects.
  - Functions that mimic the behavior of real database operations.
  - Provides dummy responses for simulating user workflows to validate the application flow.

### 8. **API Client Module**
- **Path**: `src/services/apiClient.js`
- **Role**: Handles communication with the live backend API.
- **Key Features**:
  - Functions for making HTTP requests to the live backend (e.g., using Axios or Fetch).
  - Methods for fetching user messages and storing session notes.

### 9. **Context Provider Component** (Optional)
- **Path**: `src/context/ChatContext.js`
- **Role**: Provides a context for managing global state, such as user authentication or chat history.
- **Key Features**:
  - Enables easy access to chat data throughout the application.
  - Reduces prop-drilling for commonly used state data.

## Suggested Workflow
1. **Input Handling**:
   - User types a message in the **InputBox**.
   - Message is submitted and added to the chat history in **ChatPage**.
2. **Database Communication**:
   - On submission, **ChatPage** interacts with the **Database Service Module**.
   - If using mock data, the **Mock Database Module** is queried to provide dummy responses and simulate different user workflows.
   - If live, the **API Client Module** is used to interact with the backend database.
3. **Chat Rendering**:
   - **ChatPage** updates state with the response.
   - The **ChatWindow** is updated with the new message from either the mock or live source.

## Next Steps
- Implement each component with a focus on functionality.
- Use mock data initially to simulate user interactions and validate the chat flow.
- Integrate the live backend connection once the core workflow is working smoothly.

## Notes
- Initially focus on getting the workflow and data flow working seamlessly.
- Styling and user experience enhancements can be tackled after establishing a stable workflow.
