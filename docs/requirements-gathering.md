# Requirements Gathering

## Overview

The requirements gathering stage is critical for understanding the full scope and functionality of the Virtual Psychology Assistant. During this phase, it's essential to play with ideas in a dynamic, hands-on manner to understand what the final product should look and feel like before diving into development. This involves prototyping and experimenting with a mock app, allowing for organic exploration of functionality, user experience, and workflow to ensure a well-defined vision of the final system.

## Approach to Requirements Gathering

### 1. Interactive Prototyping with Canvas
- **Objective**: Create a mock application that helps visualize and explore the core functionalities and workflows.
- **Tools and Methods**:
  - Develop low-fidelity to high-fidelity wireframes, focusing on key aspects of user interactions, resource suggestions, and conversational flow.
  - Utilize mock data to test different functionalities and flows.

### 2. User Story Exploration
- **Objective**: Define use cases from the user's perspective to ensure an intuitive user experience.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Map out various user stories, such as "new user looking for help," "returning user accessing past notes," and "user seeking a specific therapy resource."
  - Prioritize user stories based on their importance and complexity.

### 3. Workflow Simulation
- **Objective**: Simulate the entire workflow to understand the end-to-end process of how users interact with the Virtual Psychology Assistant.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Conduct scenario testing by creating mock conversations between the chatbot and potential users.
  - Assess the conversational flow, ensuring that the chatbot's prompts and suggestions align with user needs and lead them smoothly to the appropriate resources.
  - Make iterations based on the insights gained during testing.

### 4. Iterative Feedback Loop
- **Objective**: Gather continuous feedback on the mock app to refine functionality and ensure that it aligns with user needs.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Present the mock app to stakeholders and potential users to gather insights on functionality and design.
  - Identify areas that require improvement, such as response timing, conversational empathy, or user navigation.
  - Iterate on the prototype until a satisfying level of clarity on the core workflow and features is reached.

## Benefits of Mock App Exploration
- **Clear Vision**: Developing a mock app provides a clear, visual representation of the intended product, helping stakeholders and developers understand the overall functionality.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Exploring the functionality in advance reduces the risk of incorrect assumptions during development.
- **Early Validation**: Gathering feedback during this phase validates the approach and ensures that the final product meets user needs.

## Deliverables
- **Mock Application**: An interactive prototype showcasing the core features and user interactions.
- **User Story Document**: A comprehensive list of prioritized user stories.
- **Feedback Report**: Documentation of feedback collected during the iterative testing process.

## Timeline
- **Interactive Prototyping**: 3-4 weeks
- **User Story Exploration**: 1-2 weeks
- **Workflow Simulation**: 2-3 weeks

## Next Steps
- Following the requirements gathering phase, proceed to the chatbot interface design and database setup in Phase 1. Use the insights from the mock app to ensure an informed and user-centric development process.
